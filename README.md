# Page views parser

## Steps to run the project

Ruby 2.7.1 and bundler installed are required.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run:
```bundle install```
3. To run tests hit ```rspec``` in project's root directory
4. Launch the app as following:
```
ruby main.rb webserver.log
```

## Summary

I tried to write the app's code in OOP-way, as much as I could. I am aware there is a space for improvement and I definitely would like to learn it.

## Next steps

- I would consider renaming PageView and Log classes
- I was thinking about adding a new method to Parser which prints out the outcome to the CSV file 
- Also current style of displaying the outcome needs an improvement to be more readable and its code to be more elegant
